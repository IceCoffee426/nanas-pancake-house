This is a website for a fictional restaurant, created as part of the full-stack JavaScript pathway on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Description

This website has a basic HTML structure and most of the content is added to the page using JavaScript, parsed using modules and webpack. Click on the tabs to view the various content sections within the page.

## How It Was Made

- Appending content to the DOM using JavaScript.
- Separating JS code into modules and using webpack to bundle it all together.
